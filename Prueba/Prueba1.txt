Rube stood over the limp body of the Furret, cigarette in hand. It was the last one from the pack too. A bit of a sombre thought that. It was almost a miniature viking funeral in that regard. Even though the boy had been dispatched, he looked so at peace. Even in death, Tube Sock was still as carefree as ever. 

"You were quite a handful, truth be told. Always running about with that sassy attitude of yours. I'd call it endearing myself if I were generous. Perhaps I'm just jealous of all that energy you had. Shame to see it wasted now. I've never been much for sentimentality but I have to admit this does make me feel a bit teary eyed. You weren't much in the grand scheme of the world but you mattered to someone. That hat you wear, the cigarettes I smoke. Someone out there made both of those things. I may not know who they are but I'm grateful for the work they've done. And I guess I'm grateful I got to meet you for even this fleeting moment."
